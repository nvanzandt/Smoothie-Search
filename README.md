# üçπ Smoothie Search

The goal of this project was to practice React.js and API fetching. 

This website uses the Edamam Recipe Search API which allows you to search a database of over 2.3 million recipes.

### I familiarized myself with 
- React.js Hooks (State/Effect)
- Asynchronous API (async/await)
- JSX, components, props, css modules, etc.
